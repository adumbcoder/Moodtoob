# Moodtoob

## An easy mood based recommender for music videos. ##

Music is wonderful and so is music discovery! By recommending content in a new way, we give users a route for discovery. 

Users pass our application a selfie, or upload an image from their computer. the Face++ API then analyzes the image, determines users mood, and returns a selection of Youtube videos based on their mood.
